description: "How do human beings make sense of their relation to the world and realize
  their ability to effect change? One of the earliest paradigms for the investigation
  of infant learning, the so-called mobile conjugate reinforcement (MCR) paradigm,
  provides an experimental entry point to investigate the origins of agency. Infants
  begin the MCR procedure as disconnected observers, but when one of their feet is
  tethered to a mobile hanging above, some infants discover they can make the mobile
  move. Anecdotal evidence suggests that causal powers are discovered in coordination
  (Piaget, 1952), but up to now quantifiable signatures of such are wanting. Conscious
  agency may appear suddenly as an ‘aha!’ experience or gradually, but only a complete
  dynamical analysis of the experimental arrangement can tell. To this end, we conducted
  an MCR study with 3-4 month infants and tracked infant and (for the first time)
  mobile position in 3D space at 100 Hz using a Vicon mocap system. These 3D timeseries
  are presented here. \n\nReferences:\nJ. Piaget, The origins of intelligence in children,
  pp. 161. (Norton & Co., 1952)."
